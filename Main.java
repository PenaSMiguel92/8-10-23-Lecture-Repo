/*
 * Garbage Collection - 
 * Every time an object is created, it goes into heap memory. 
 * 
 * Different objects take up different amounts of memory space.
 * An object with 20 different instance variable will take up more space than an object with 5 different instance variables.
 * 
 * The heap is where garbage collection happens. Note: we cannot force garbage collection in Java.
 * We can only suggest garbage collection to happen using System.gc() but it is not guaranteed to occur.
